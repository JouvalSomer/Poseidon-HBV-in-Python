# HBV Hydrological Model Simulation

This project contains a Python implementation of the HBV (Hydrologiska Byr√•ns Vattenbalansavdelning) hydrological model. The model is used for simulating snow accumulation and melt, evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and discharge.

## Description

The HBV model takes meteorological data as input and simulates several hydrological processes. The core of this implementation lies in the `HBVModel` class, which processes temperature and precipitation data to simulate snow accumulation and melt, soil moisture dynamics, evapotranspiration, and streamflow generation.

## Installation

To run this script, you need Python installed on your system. The script has been tested with Python 3.8. Additionally, you need to install the required packages. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the model, execute the script `Poseidon_paralell.py`. The script performs a Monte Carlo simulation to find optimal parameters for the model. The number of simulations and the R2 score threshold for saving results are configurable by the user.

```bash
python Poseidon_paralell.py
```

Follow the prompts to enter the number of simulations (`num_sim`) and the R2 score threshold (`R2_threshold`).

## Structure

- `HBVModel`: A class that encapsulates the HBV model's logic.
- `run_simulation`: A function that runs a single instance of the model simulation with a given set of parameters, considering the R2 threshold.
- `main`: The main function of the script, which sets up the simulation parameters, including the R2 threshold, and runs the model simulations in parallel.

## Output

The script outputs several plots showing the relationship between the model parameters and their performance, as well as plots for different hydrological variables over time. Additionally, it saves the optimal model parameters to a file `optimal_parameters.txt` based on the R2 threshold.
